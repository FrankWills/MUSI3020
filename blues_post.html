            <p class="lead">Thoughts on how the documentary "The Land Where the Blues Began" contextualizes the Blues.</p>
            <p>&emsp;The film “The Land Where the Blues Began” looks into the history of the Blues and explores its origins through interviews with people who experienced it. The documentary is organized by the different activities and circumstances in the Mississippi Delta that contributed to the Blues. Each section follows roughly the same format: Alan Lomax narrates a brief introduction to a part of life in the Mississippi Delta, there is an interview with someone discussing their own life experiences, there is a performance of the music, and then narration to transition into the next topic. The topics go through fife and drum bands, brutal work conditions, worship in churches, cruel prison labor, and toasts given in bars. In this way it relates the Blues to the injustice and hardship forced on Black people living in Mississippi.</p>
            <p>&emsp;The documentary refuses to divorce the context of the Blues from the music, and I think that is one of its greatest strengths in regards to ethnomusicology. Aside from the brief section on the ties between African musical traditions and the Blues, almost no time is spent attempting to compare the Blues to other musical styles or pick at it with the typical lens of musical analysis. Instead, it prioritizes accounts of what Black Americans were going through that tied into the Blues. Similarly, the recorded performances are not restricted to a studio or stage, but are instead taken wherever the people are. The work songs are performed in the fields and on the railroad tracks, the toasts are recorded at the table, and many of the songs are sung on porches. This helps to ensure that the performances are not cheapened by being presented in a vacuum.</p>
            <p>&emsp;The Blues featured in this documentary put a lot of emphasis on how the lyrics directly tie into the experiences and the struggles of the people performing them, and I think that is part of why it feels so wrong when someone tries to emulate the Blues in a disingenuous way. We have covered the dangers of cultural tourism and cultural appropriation in this class previously, but this documentary really enforced that idea. Yes, it is possible to play a 12 bar pattern and mimic the raw vocal style, but without a genuine link to the hardship that birthed the Blues it comes across as disrespectful. This documentary did a good job reinforcing that idea by juxtaposing the oral history with the performances from the same people. After hearing Walter Brown recount how he was threatened at gunpoint to work and seeing the reenactment of a prison work song from the people who lived through it, how can I see the commodification of the Blues as anything but disrespectful?</p>
            <p>&emsp;Like the rest of Alan Lomax’s work in the Lomax Archives, “The Land Where the Blues Began” prioritizes first-hand accounts and performances in the places they originated to provide a look into the circumstances that birthed the Blues. It is extremely focused onto this idea and offers very few additions of outside information or musical styles to avoid misrepresenting or mis-contextualizing the words of the people being interviewed.
