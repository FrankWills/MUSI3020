              &emsp;For this portfolio post I wanted to go back to the prompt of Post 5. This album is something I found about thirty minutes after publishing my post about music from European traditions and I could not believe how well it fit that post’s topic. The Hungarian musician Gábor Szabó’s album Dreams was released in 1968 and blends traditional Hungarian styles with American jazz and pop music. It features seven tracks at roughly five minutes each. Gábor Szabó’s guitar playing is at the forefront with an assortment of rhythmic and harmonic accompaniment from a variety of instruments.<br>
              &emsp;Gábor Szabó was born in Hungary and fled to America due to the Hungarian anti-Communist Revolution when he was 20. After attending Berklee and playing in a few bands in LA, Gábor Szabó’s albums would start to find success in the 60’s. Famous guitarist Carlos Santana covered one of his songs and helped to popularize his music even further. <br>
              &emsp;The musicians credited on Dreams play Upright Bass, Cello, Drum set, French Horn, Guitar, Percussion, Congas, Piano, and Violin. Many of these instruments like the Violin and the Guitar are played in the Hungarian styles, while others like the Upright Bass and Horns borrow more from American Jazz and Psychedelic pop. This is probably best represented in the track “Fire Dance,” where there is a contrast between Gábor Szabó’s guitar solo improvisation, which makes heavy use of runs and harmony present in traditional Hungarian music, and the horn interjections that fit into the 60’s Psychadelic style (a famous example of this style can be found in the older James Bond themes). <br>
              &emsp;One final note about Gábor Szabó is that many of his song titles feature the word “Gypsy” or imagery surrounding “Gypsy Culture.” While Gábor was from Hungary and was probably familiar with the actual cultural practices of Eastern Europe, it is important to note that this time period also featured a lot of misrepresentation and cultural appropriation around “Gypsy” stereotypes, and many people consider the word itself to be a slur. Cultural Tourism was a large aspect of the Psychedelic movement of that time, with companies and artists using misrepresentations of world cultures as a way to market “exotic” goods or art. This led to several “mystic” stereotypes forming around other cultures (primarily over generalizations of different Eastern European, African, Indian, Eastern Asian, and Native American cultural practices). Many of these stereotypes are still common today, so I think it would be irresponsible not to bring it up. There is always a question with popular music from this era as to how much the artists had to compromise their own cultural identity to fit into the stereotypes that would be popular with American audiences.<br>
              &emsp;I thoroughly enjoyed this album and I am glad to have had the chance to write about it. I might have been able to compare it more to some of the other traditional music we studied in the Europe unit if I had found it earlier, but it was very interesting to dive into how Gábor Szabó’s music tied into Hungarian culture and history.<br>
