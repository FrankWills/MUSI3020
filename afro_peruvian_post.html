            <p class="lead">Some thoughts about the documentary "A Zest for Life: Afro-Peruvian Rhythms"</p>
            <p>&emsp;The documentary “A Zest for Life: Afro-Peruvian Rhythms” is unlike almost any of the documentaries I have seen before. I would even say that it is more like a concert with a voiceover than a traditional documentary, as it mostly consists of un-edited full performances of Afro-Peruvian music and dance. Most directors might only display a snippet of any given example to save time at the risk of cheapening or misrepresenting the performance, but this documentary refuses to do that. This documentary also does not shy away from the history of slavery in Peru and how that had a major impact on the themes and influences of Afro-Peruvian Music. Many of the songs are about the racial discrimination and danger that came with slavery and subsequent racism in Peru.

                &emsp;I think the most important moment of the documentary occurs roughly halfway through when master Cajon player Lalo Isquierdo demonstrates various Afro-Peruvian rhythms. I will be honest that my own ability to follow rhythms is not great. Most of my formal music knowledge is linked to the trombone, an instrument that is limited in how fast it can play by the movement of the slide, so most of the pieces I learned were rhythmically slower. Still, even without following along perfectly I can tell that the rhythms Lalo Isquierdo plays are extremely complex and difficult to perform. On my first watch through I did not notice that he moves his leg up and down along the Cajon to change the pitch of the drumming. As he shifts through the different styles and countries we can hear the differences in sound. The US rhythm has much more emphasis on the down-beats and to me sounds steadier when compared to the Peruvian rhythm, which took me much longer to get a feel for. In the other examples of Afro-Peruvian music I noticed that the rhythmic subdivisions were much smaller. Even in the slower “Toro Mata”, the overlaying of the different instrument rhythms makes for many subdivisions of the beat. It retains the slow feel, but if you try to notate it it is extremely complex. It might also just be my personal lack of exposure to Peruvian music, but it took me longer to feel whether a song was 4/4 or 3/4 than it normally does with music I am more familiar with. Overall I really enjoyed this documentary and how it made me consider the sources of the rhythms that are present in what I listen to. The idea that a specific type of rhythm could be unique from somewhere is not something I had considered.
