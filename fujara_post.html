  &emsp;The Fujara is a large aerophone that originated in the Tatra Mountains of central Slovakia. It has a distinct sound that uses overblowing and overtones to extend its range. I have included two videos of the fujara being played. One is from a lecture at The Library of Congress that includes both solo performances of central Slovakian folk music and a discussion about Slovakian folk music in general. The second features a more condensed look at the Fujara and some of the people who make and play it. It includes snapshots of several different performances, including a few more contemporary performances featuring several Fujaras being played in unison. One of these included some percussive bell like instruments that provided an accompaniment by rattling.</p>
            <p>&emsp;One note I found interesting about the Fujara playing style is that it commonly features a sung verse or interlude in between the Fujara phrases. The style of singing for this verse mimics the sound of the Fujara, following a similar shape to that of the phrase. Both the singing and the Fujara make heavy use of a trill/vibrato effect. The videos claim that this is to mimic sounds in nature like the bubbling of a creek or a birdsong. The lyrics I could find that were translated described the life and troubles of a shepherd, with themes of finding food for the herd and staying out of conflict. The function of this could be described as preserving the way of life of the shepherd and providing an outlet in a generally lonesome occupation.</p>
            <p>&emsp;The majority of the performances I could find were still by shepherds in central Slovakia. I believe this is fairly unique, as shepherding is becoming less common in modern society and it does not seem that the instrument has spread much outside of its original culture. As such, there is not much to speak to as far as diversity within the tradition.</p>
            <p>&emsp;I could not find much information linking the fujara to a religious group or tradition, although nomadic and shepherd traditions are commonly shared or linked to religious traditions. The majority of Slovakians today are part of the Roman Catholic Church, with a smaller number of Protestants and Greek Catholics occupying much of the remaining population. Unfortunately, studying the religious breakdown of Slovakia and the neighboring Czech Republic is a difficult task. Several of the largest conflicts in Europe, including both World Wars, have split along the border between the previous sovereign state of Czechoslovakia and Austria-Hungary. This has resulted in many religious traditions of the Slovakian people being lost to war and genocide. The Jewish population in Slovakia is still magnitudes smaller than it was at the start of the 20th century. In addition, Czechoslovakia was on the border of the iron curtain that existed throughout much of the 20th century, so little information about Slovakian culture spread to the West. As such, it is possible that some of the origins and traditions associated with the instrument have been lost to conflict and time.</p>
