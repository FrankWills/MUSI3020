            <p>&emsp; I mentioned some of this in my last post, but I got a lot of my musical inspiration from my family. My dad loved to collect music, especially rock. I would be playing on the floor in his office while he put on Beatles albums as he worked. He didn’t play an instrument, but his ear was incredible and one of his favorite games to play on roadtrips was saying the name of a song as fast as possible when the radio came on. Usually it would only take him a note or two to be able to pick out the name and artist. Even without any playing experience he could usually figure out a melody on a piano just by thinking about it.
                &emsp;He also contributed in less direct ways to my current musical taste. When I was first learning to use the computer he gave me a couple hundred midi files of songs he knew. Midi soundfonts get a bad reputation for being cheap sounding and lacking expression, but I think getting early exposure to that “instrument” played a big part in how I listen to chiptune and other genres that make heavy use of midi. Other people are turned away because it comes across as cheezy, but to me it sounds just as familiar as physical instruments. He was also the person who got me into playing video games, so even though I found chiptune on my own, he was the one who gave me the background to appreciate it.<br>
                &emsp;My mom played piano growing up, and I remember listening to her play hymns in the evening. She didn’t listen to music as much while working because it distracted her, but she loved music from church and soundtracks. My mom grew up Catholic and when she married my dad (a Methodist), they decided to keep both faiths. My sister and I grew up going to alternating churches each week, and once we were old enough, two churches a week. She made sure that we were involved, signing us up for the youth choir in one church and lectoring (reading the verses selected for each week to the congregation) in the other. When quarantine started and I went home for the summer, we would still gather every Sunday morning with her hymnal and sing along with the livestreams of the services. I don’t sing on my own, but singing in a crowd is much easier. Even though I would not call reading scripture “music” on its own, there are skills that are used in both, such as adding emphasis to different parts of a phrase to invoke different emotions.<br>
                &emsp;There was recently some information that came to light involving one of the people who wrote many of the hymns we sing that led to those hymns being taken out of the rotation of music we can sing at church. This was a necessary and good step for protecting the victims and making clear that that abusive behavior is never ok, but that also meant giving up several of the songs that had been a part of our lives for years. I think it is important to note that music being tied to our culture also means accepting a risk, that memories and bonds made over a piece of music can be corrupted by the actions of the composers and performers of that music.<br>
