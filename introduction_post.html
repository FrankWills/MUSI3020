            <p>&emsp;Hey everybody, my name is Frank Wills (he/him). I am a 4th year Computer Science major, 
                but music has played just as big of a role in my life as computers. I started learning 
                guitar in elementary school but did not start practicing until just a few years ago 
                (so don't expect much). I also marched trombone all throughout high school and recently 
                started learning bass guitar. My dad definitely played the biggest role in getting me 
                into music early on. He showed me the Beatles and Steely Dan (his favorite song was 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDZdNr9PHao">Charlie Freak</a>). After he 
                passed away I learned to appreciate all sorts of music by just listening to whatever my 
                friends recommended. Originally I did not like most non-rock genres (electronic, country, 
                rap), but the more I listened to them the more I found I liked them. The book mentions 
                how familiarity with particular musical styles shapes how we think about music, and I got 
                to see firsthand how exposure to new music changed my opinion of it.</p><br>
                <p>&emsp;My favorite song is <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doesfmrk9bQ'>ASGORE</a> by Toby Fox. It is a chiptune track from the 2015 game Undertale. Technically it consists of two tracks, Bergentruckung and ASGORE, but they are intended to be played together. I could probably write several pages about what makes this song special to me, but I will try to organize myself to three points:<br>
                1. How I found it.<br>
                2. A particular part of the song I like.<br>
                3. My experiences with it since then.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                  &emsp;First off, chiptune is special to me because it is one of the few genres I found for myself. Rock, rap, pop, all of these I absorbed from listening to the radio or from my friends, but chiptune was something I found through my own interests. It is often criticized for its use of low quality midi instruments and the "video game" sound, but as someone who grew up playing and listening to music from games I don't really notice these qualities. I knew about Undertale before its release because of remixes I found on soundcloud and pages I followed. This was when I was in high school trying to find out where I belonged, and while I still enjoyed other music, I will always have a very personal connection to the Undertale soundtrack.<br>
                  &emsp;Secondly, the song itself is phenomenal. Toby Fox is a composer first and a game developer second, so the entire soundtrack is threaded together with leitmotifs. As much as I would like to go through each one that gets used and how it relates back to the other tracks, I will stick to a specific example that can be heard independently. If you have not already, listen to the repeating figure at 1:11. It repeats four times with slight changes to the ending each time. The first and third times through it ends with a harmony that sounds powerful and majestic, but the second and fourth times through it ends with a tragic, almost heartbreaking harmony that kills me every time I hear it (Relevant: this hearkens back to a previous track <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xflkF-sqNaM">Heartache</a>). This contrast of power and tragedy has always stuck with me and I still get chills to this day.<br>
                  &emsp;Third and lastly, this track is almost 5 years old. Since 2015 a lot has happened in my life, and through it all I have been listening to this song. It has become my go-to song for preparing for an exam. Before corona I would play it on repeat during the bus rides to my exams. Regardless of how good it was when I first heard it, listening to something that many times in such stressful situations has strengthened my attachment to it.<br>
                  &emsp;I hope even if you do not like the way chiptune sounds you can appreciate this track. Sorry for going so far over the paragraph limit, I just really like this piece and I lost track of time. I look forward to being in this class with everyone!<br>
