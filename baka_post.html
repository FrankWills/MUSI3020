            <p class="lead">Some thoughts on the documentary "Baka: Cry from the Rainforest".</p>
            <p>&emsp;The documentary “Baka: Cry from the Rainforest” opens with footage shot years prior of the Congo Rainforest. The narration sets the scene, describing a previous filming of the Baka people and introducing the family we would meet, but I found it difficult to focus on the voice in the presence of so much background noise. Rainforests are generally loud places, full of birds calling, leaves rattling, and the steady hum of bugs. For this reason I also completely missed the ambient music playing in this intro sequence on my first viewing. The soft synth instrumentation makes it unlikely that this is a Baka song, but it raised an interesting question: how does music interact with the environment it is played in? I kept this question in the back of my mind throughout the viewing and the more I thought about it the more I began to think about how strange it was that the music I listen to on a daily basis is so removed from my environment.<br>
            &emsp;Every morning and every evening I take a walk down the road outside my apartment complex. Riverbend Parkway is odd in that some stretches are heavily forested, lacking even light posts to light the way through the night, and other stretches are full of buildings and cleared parking space. In one spot I can stand and see the untouched banks of the Oconnee river and then turn around to a fence that says “No Trespassing, UGA Golf Course”. I get to choose whether I want to be surrounded by reeds or manicured grass every time I walk out my door. Similarly, while most days I walk with earbuds in listening to music someone put together in a digital workstation, I will sometimes take them out and just listen to the sounds around me. I have the choice between nature and artificial and I overwhelmingly choose artificial.<br>
            &emsp;That choice is not always offered to everyone, as we see in the documentary. This was filmed largely as a response to the previous documentary, and each time the narrator mentions how a spot used to be “teeming with monkeys” and is now silent or a type of tree used in medicines can no longer reproduce, we see the choice between nature and artificial being taken away. Ali, the main person we follow during the documentary, says, “There are so few animals here now, just hunters with guns, who destroy everything.” As the nature is taken away from them it becomes harder and harder for the Baka people to maintain their culture. Furthermore, the lure of alcohol addiction and the encroaching of logging operations makes it increasingly difficult to preserve their way of life. The narrator describes how the people who would once have had a chance to hunt in the forest now can only sing about “the animals their fathers hunted”. Finally, we get the most tragic line in ethnomusicology “Drinking has made us forget how to play”. It was incredibly sad to have the most musical examples come from funerals.<br>
            &emsp;This documentary showed a tragic situation where a culture is actively being erased through outside influence and the people are forced to cope as best they can. I honestly do not have much to offer in the way of musical analysis other than reiterating the point that music in culture is a precious yet fragile thing, and seeing the loss of Baka music mirrors the destruction of the Baka way of life.<br><br>
