            <p class="lead">Learn even more about me and the music I like to listen to.</p>
            <p>&emsp;Hello again! If you didn't get a chance to read my post on the discussion board last weekend, you can see that <a href="introduction_post.html">here.</a> I am still Frank Wills (he/him) and I still enjoy listening to <i>ASGORE</i> by Toby Fox.My major is Computer Science (because people will pay me to write code for them) and I play a few instruments in my spare time to cool down after work or class (because people will NOT pay me to play music). I’ve been playing guitar since elementary school, I marched trombone in high school, and recently I picked up electric bass (if you haven’t guessed from the previous comment, I am not particularly good at any of these). I’ve also sang in church all my life, although I do not have any classical training there.</p>
              <p>&emsp;If I am being honest though, I really prefer listening to music over playing it. The experience of playing music is great and I do not mean to imply that I dislike it, but being able to listen to a great musician without worrying if I am going to mess up is a much more enjoyable experience for me. My favorite pastime is walking around campus and listening through an album. Often I will find myself taking the longest route to where I want to go just so I can listen all the way through an album.</p>
              
              <p>&emsp;The three largest influences on my taste in music have been my family, my friends, and the internet. For the sake of structure, I will go through each one and talk about how they have shaped the way I hear music.</p>
              <h3>My Family</h3>
              <p>&emsp;
              My family shaped most of my musical taste growing up. My dad in particular really loved rock and would play the White Album almost every time we had to drive somewhere (I suspect one of the reasons he let me take guitar lessons was so I would play live music in the house). Some of the bands I learned to like from him are ELO, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, and AC/DC. My mom liked more musical and movie soundtracks, especially Phantom of the Opera and The Music Man. I have really fond memories of all these songs, and being introduced to them early on was what really jump started my continuing love of music.
              </p>
              <p>&emsp;
              As much as I love the music I learned from my family, I have to admit that I also got some bad habits from the people around me growing up, particularly the idea that some genres were “music” and everything else was just noise. Because of this I did not really get a chance to experience many of my favorite bands until much later in my life.
              </p>
              <h3>My Friends</h3>
              <p>&emsp;
              I have been really lucky to have friends who love music as much as I do. Just recently a friend recommended The Oh Hellos to me and I’ve been listening to their albums on repeat ever since. I think this is also how I’ve heard the widest range of things, from my old roommate who played whaling songs to my osu friends who tell me about all sorts of niche vocaloid tracks. We all agree on a few bands (Anamanaguchi and Tame Impala for instance), but they constantly find new ways to impress me and more often than not their recommendations end up in my daily playlists.
              </p>
              <h3>The Internet</h3>
              <p>&emsp;
              The internet has got to be the most interesting influence here. If I had traveled back 20, or even 10 years ago I would probably have listed the radio here, but for my generation music streaming services have been the way we find new artists. Algorithms in Pandora, Spotify, Soundcloud, and Youtube have drastically shaped my taste in music. I cannot even begin to list the bands who I found through these sites because I wouldn’t know where to stop. Every track I love has a recommended page full of 10 other tracks I love, I would be here forever. I really cannot understate how important these sites have been to my growth as a musician and a music lover.
