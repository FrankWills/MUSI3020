              <h3>Victor Wooten: Music as a Language</h3>
              &emsp;Music has become a major part of growing up through the US education system, where for the most part it is taught in the same way one would learn math or science; a musical concept is explained through a lesson, and then the student practices those concepts with scales and drills. Victor Wooten, one of the most influential bass guitar players of all time, claims he did not learn this way. Since the start of the 2000s he has dedicated his time towards advocating for a different method of learning music, treating it less like a subject and more like a language. Victor Wooten’s philosophy of “music as a language” was shaped more by his family, his fellow musicians, and his personal experiences teaching students than conventional American music education, and as a result offers a unique angle of music education that may be more inclusive for beginners, especially those whose musical background does not match the eurocentric styles most commonly taught in public schools. In this paper I will look at interviews and content published by Victor Wooten to explain his education philosophy with the purpose of comparing it to issues in modern music education.<br>&emsp;
              The electric bass occupies a strange spot in most modern music. It’s role is often described as the “foundation” of the sound, but while it is easy to follow the melody of the lead instruments and the driving beat of the percussive instruments, the bass is often buried somewhere in between. It can act as both a percussive and melodic voice, but does not cut through the sound as well as the other instruments that commonly accompany it. Interestingly, this also seems to carry over to the bassists themselves. As rock and other popular genres of music in America have become increasingly more focused on the personalities of the performers, the bassist often still takes a background role. Most people can name their favorite guitarist or vocalist, and even drummers often form their own cult followings, but the list of popular bassists is relatively short. Victor Wooten is one of the few that manages to consistently make that list. His style of playing that refuses to be buried and his magnetic personality set him apart from other bassists.<br>&emsp;
              Growing up as a bass prodigy, Victor Wooten became known for playing the bass exceptionally well for his age. By the time he was only five years old he was playing on stage with his brothers in their family band “The Wootens”. However, where most prodigies eventually fade back into their peers, he continued to innovate and grow. He became known for the “double-thumb” slap bass technique that he helped to popularize. This technique, demonstrated in his performance of “Classical Thump,” allows bassists to perform lines that rival the speed of guitar solos. In response to criticism that this style of playing was abandoning the purpose of the bass, Wooten replied that he and his friends were “... going past being a bass player and are being musicians,” indicating that the goals of the instrument came second to the goals of the musician. His first solo record “A Show of Hands” was recorded entirely on a single four-string bass and is regarded as one of the most influential bass records of all time. After years of jumping between record labels he formed his own label called Vix Records to release his music. Victor Wooten went on to win 5 Grammys throughout his career and has been featured on some of the most prestigious publications in the music community, including the Rolling Stone’s top 10 bassists of all time.<br>&emsp;
            Victor Wooten is also unique among bassists in that he continues to use a four-string bass for the majority of his work, whereas most other solo bassists will shift to a five or six-string bass to extend their range. A beginning bassist with a four-string can look at Victor Wooten’s instrument and recognize that the only barrier between being able to sound like him is experience. This kind of connection between the professional and the student is similar to Victor Wooten’s own learning process, where he claims he still has a child-like view of the bass. In an interview with fellow bass instructor Scott Devine, Victor Wooten details how he learned harmonics, a high level bass technique, in a single night because he wanted to play the piece “Portrait of Tracy” by Jaco Pastorius. This piece would be regarded as impossible for a beginner to play, but as a child Victor Wooten was only concerned that it sounded cool and was able to push himself to learn it through his own motivation.<br>&emsp;
              Victor Wooten also describes his earliest experiences with music as being similar to how a child learns a language; by being immersed directly into it. He was born as the youngest of five brothers and attributes most of his early musical development to them, especially his oldest brother Regi. He says in his TEDx talk that, “ The fact that they [his brothers] were already playing and we got to be a part of what the big brothers were doing made it that much more special.” The brothers were quickly noticed for their talent and ended up opening for acts like Curtis Mayfield and The Temptations. Being surrounded by other talented musicians and listening to what they had to “say” through their music, Victor Wooten found himself picking up their techniques and skills. He says it was valuable to be able to share the stage with these skilled musicians just as a child is allowed to share the same space as people skilled at speaking, despite their young age.<br>&emsp;
              This experience greatly shaped his musical education philosophy. Few musicians have been as passionate about music education as Victor Wooten, writing the book “The Music Lesson: A Spiritual Search for Growth Through Music” and leading a series of summer music education camps on the property in Tennessee called “Wooten’s Woods”. He frequently refers to his philosophy of music education as treating “Music as a Language,” or in other words, emulating the immersive process a young child takes to learn a language but with music. As mentioned previously, this was something Victor Wooten was able to experience firsthand growing up. In contrast to the music education system that most schools and instructors take that asks a student to pick an instrument and then practice technique through drills and scales, “Music as a Language” focuses on the act of performance and learning through participation with other musicians. <br>&emsp;
            Just as he had the opportunity to play alongside some of the great musicians of his time, Victor Wooten now offers others the chance to play alongside him, stopping in to impromptu bass workshops and events in addition to his scheduled appearances. This openness to play alongside beginners is a core tenet of the “Music as a Language” process. In his TEDx Talk, Victor Wooten explains that, when learning to speak, “even as a baby you are jamming with professionals.” He applies this concept by “having conversations” musically with new bass players, even though they might not have the musical “grammar” or “vocabulary” built up yet. It is less about the actual achievement or competition of the performers. In fact, he uses the example of an air guitar to reinforce that there does not even need to be sound produced, so long as there is some participation in the musical event. Purely having a role, even a silent one, is important and allows musicians of any skill level to develop together. In an NAMM oral history recording, Victor Wooten says “I want to spread why my parents gave to us to as many people as possible.” It is in this way that Victor Wooten interprets his upbringing alongside talented musicians as a form of this musical conversation and seeks to “pay it forward”.<br>&emsp;
            It is important to note that Victor Wooten does not believe conventional practice is entirely useless. The goal of “Music as a Language” is not to entirely do away with technical drills or time spent alone with an instrument. After all, most children learning english still need to practice the more difficult concepts to become fully proficient at speaking. Instead, he wants to focus on development of the musician and their musical “voice” prior to giving them drills. In his TEDx talk he says, “It wasn’t about learning the instrument first. Who cares about the instrument you talk with. It's about what you have to say.” Prioritizing musical voice over any one instrument also plays into Victor Wooten’s upbringing. While he repeatedly states he was born into the bass player role, he also mentions how his older brother Regi made efforts to give Victor something to do before he could even hold a proper instrument. He says he progressed from a toy guitar to a guitar modified by taking off the highest two strings, and then finally to the electric bass. By taking part in the music as a participant and not just an observer, he was able to build up his musical ability, so much so that by the time he actually picked up the bass he was already able to incorporate into the ensemble. He found what he wanted to say musically first, and then learned the technical skills required to say it.<br>&emsp;
            Some might find the “Music as a Language” approach to be overly simplistic or unviable for practical application. Coming from almost any other famous musician that would be an understandable reservation, but Victor Wooten has spent the last 11 years applying and refining this ideology at the Victor Wooten Center for Music and Nature. Even in the face of the Coronavirus, which has presented a major obstacle for practically all in-person music, Victor Wooten’s camps are still running and applying the “Music as a Language” approach. It is described as a “non-competitive environment”, which runs against the normally contentious hierarchy of modern school bands and orchestras. These years of experience directly applying the philosophy he champions has given Victor Wooten a great deal of credibility and helped to break the barrier that most educational ideology runs into between theory and practice. He has personally gone through the effort to prove its worth beyond pure thought experiment.<br>&emsp;
              A recent discussion in the music education community has been about eurocentricity and how music theory generally favors white male composers. Professor Philip Ewell from Hunter College of the City University of New York published a paper that discusses how “...there exists a ‘white racial frame’ in music theory that is structural and institutionalized...”. This white racial frame is constructed by the historic and systematic prioritization of white male european composers in music theory, sometimes as a matter of convenience but sometimes as part of intentionally racist and biggoted views. He makes clear that he does not believe that the 18th century european composers focused on by music education are unworthy of study, but rather that by presenting their works as the basis for “objectively good music” and applying the metrics of analysis designed for their works to other cultures and styles without context creates a “white racial frame”. A work is no longer judged by the merits of the culture it arose from, but rather by a potentially unrelated culture with different thoughts about what constitutes “good music”. In some ways ethnomusicology offers more information about the theories of music that current popular styles are derived from than “music theory” classes, especially as online streaming platforms have expanded the range of cultural music backgrounds available to any given person. Giving one culture’s school of thought the title of “music theory” implies a certain amount of objectivity, and thus has been used to devalue certain popular genres, particularly those that arose from communities of color like jazz and rap. For example, infamous political figure Ben Shapiro has claimed that, because rap does not conform to the musical qualities his “music theorist father” set forth, it is not music. This “white racial frame” is heavily linked to how music is taught to young musicians, and has led to an uphill battle for musicians of color in the education system.<br>&emsp;
            Victor Wooten’s music education philosophy can be used to avoid this issue by letting the students learn from the music around them instead of presenting them with a set of pieces to learn from. The student is encouraged to learn directly from what they listen to, thereby including the cultural and personal contexts that may be absent in the eurocentric pieces that are most commonly chosen for music education. After all, the point of musical education is to help students explore and grow in their own musical journey. Forcing those students to play pieces they do not feel a connection to will not advance them in the directions they want to go with music. Victor Wooten firmly believes that music is a form of self expression. In a discussion with a music teacher, he says that “sometimes, music can express yourself better than words,” and in his TED talk he says “Many music teachers never find out what their students have to say, they only tell them what they are supposed to say.” If a student is never asked what they have to say musically and is instead forced to say something they disagree with, that student’s voice is being suppressed.<br>&emsp;
            Victor Wooten has also directly addressed racism in his music and interviews. In an interview from 2009 with Anil Prasad, Victor Wooten describes how his parents experienced extreme racism, with his pregnant mother being forced to give up her seat on a bus. He mentions how the 2008 election of President Barack Obama “... meant a lot of change, but there is still a lot of change that has to come.” In another interview with GuitarWorld columnist Ellen O’Reilly, Victor Wooten and his brothers speak about some of their experiences with racism growing up and the strong example their parents set for them. Victor Wooten says that his parents, “wanted to make sure that we knew who we were, and that we supported each other in a world that might not support us back.” Roy Wooten mentions how he felt like an underdog growing up in, “a racial time, with everybody calling you names, with no respect for what you’re doing, who you are or what you hope to be.” The experience of being alienated and disrespected purely on the basis of race is unfortunately still present in music, and while Victor Wooten and his brothers were able to get through it and find success, there are many more artists and musicians who get systematically devalued and oppressed by no fault of their own. <br>&emsp;
            The lyrics to Victor Wooten’s song “I Saw God” are also clearly about racism and bigotry, specifically in relation to religion. In the interview with Anil Prasad, he says the goal of the song was to get people to “...question their beliefs...” specifically in relation to seeing God as a specific gender or race. This ties back to the idea of claiming the musical ideas and standards of a specific culture, race, or gender as objective “music theory,” as it implies a certain amount of superiority. This song aims to counteract that idea and get people to consider the question in Christianity “...why won’t God appear as you or me, as well as people of different races?”<br>&emsp;
            Victor Wooten offers a fresh voice on music education that is sorely needed in a system that is increasingly criticized for its lack of connection to its students. His philosophies have proven credibility through years of application at his camps, but they have not become distanced from the application as so many education philosophies are prone to do. His continued connection to not only the professionals he works with but also his family and students, even after becoming successful, demonstrates a level of humbleness and humility that can act as an inspiration to all music educators.<br>&emsp;
