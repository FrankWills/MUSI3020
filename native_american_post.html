            <p class="lead">An analysis of Native American Performance recordings by Alan Lomax.</p>
            <p>&emsp;The Lomax archives poses an interesting historical snapshot, not just into the cultures of the people who were recorded, but also into Lomax’s personal framings of the recordings and how these people were perceived by white america. When searching for recordings, often terms like “Eskimo” or “Indian” yield more complete search results than the names that Native Americans have requested to be addressed by. Even the collection itself is known as “The Alan Lomax Archives,” a title that gives credit to Lomax instead of the people who he recorded. The website mentions that the recordings include every single tape that was captured, even if they were captured “...inadvertently, when Alan left the tape machine running.” In this way it offers a unique opportunity to an ethnomusicologist to not only analyse the cultural context of Native American music, but also to reflect on how the field can better respect and acknowledge the cultures that it interacts with in the future.</p>
