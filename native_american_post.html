            <p class="lead">An analysis of Native American Performance recordings by Alan Lomax.</p>
            <p>&emsp;The Lomax archives poses an interesting historical snapshot, not just into the cultures of the people who were recorded, but also into Lomax’s personal framings of the recordings and how these people were perceived by white america. When searching for recordings, often terms like “Eskimo” yield more complete search results than the names that Native Americans have requested to be addressed by. Even the collection itself is known as “The Alan Lomax Archives,” a title that gives credit to Lomax instead of the people who he recorded. The website mentions that the recordings include every single tape that was captured, even if they were captured “...inadvertently, when Alan left the tape machine running.” In this way it offers a unique opportunity to an ethnomusicologist to not only analyse the cultural context of Native American music, but also to reflect on how the field can better respect and acknowledge the cultures that it interacts with in the future.
              <br>&emsp;I listened to two recordings from the archive: “In My Own Native Land,” a work song recorded in Saint Andrew, Grenada, and “Ay, Mi Palomo,” a Chilean Chapecao. Most of the analysis we have done in this section has been on Native American music of the North American Plains, but since I had trouble finding recordings that fit this description I picked these two recordings from different parts of America, one the Carribean and one South America. I will do my best to compare the styles back to the analysis we did in the section.
              <br>&emsp;The recording of “In My Own Native Land” features five credited performers doing a task while singing a call and response song and occasionally clapping. The recording is dated 1962 and the setting is an agricultural field. There is one main performer who sings a short verse in Grenadian Creole English, and then the other performers respond with “in my own native land.” The concept of call and response is featured heavily in several of the Native American traditions we have studied, although it is unlikely that this piece was directly influenced by those groups given the location. The use of clapping as percussion is also a common feature of Native American music, although the lack of an aerophone or membranophone is less common. The genre is labeled as Afro-caribbean, which implies that the shared characteristics are more likely to be coincidental and instead more directly related to African traditions that were spread as part of slavery. As part of my discussion post I discussed the track “Ocean Prayer” by PAMYUA, an Inuit band from Alaska. I think these two pieces feature the most similarities, as their primary focus is on a single vocalist with minimal percussion added and additional vocal performers added periodically.
              <br>&emsp;The recording of “Ay, Mi Palomo” is much different, featuring very few similarities with any of the music we have heard as part of this unit. The instrumentation is the most striking; a solo guitar provides chords as a vocalist sings. Not only are there no aerophones or membranophones, but stringed instruments have been exceptionally uncommon in the music we have analysed so far, usually only added to more modern recordings of performances. The solo performer is also somewhat uncommon. Typically there are at least two performers, even if one is not making any sound and instead performs a dance. This recording is listed as being from 1956 in London, although the song is still listed as originating in Chile. This is a common trend I have noticed when watching the performances from my classmates discussions. It seems that it is very common for these performances to happen outside the Americas. It is not clear why, although it could be speculated that this is linked to the historical tension and crimes against Native Americans by settlers. Russia for instance seems to be a common place for modern Native American music groups to tour, and they would not have the same reaction to the historical significance of some of these performances that someone from the US might. That said, it does not mean that they would understand the significance of it or would be immune to reducing the performance to cultural tourism. Regardless, this piece seems to have very little in common with the rest of the performances we have heard.
